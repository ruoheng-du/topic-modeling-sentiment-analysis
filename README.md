# Analysis of Chinese Financial Discourse Based on Topic Clustering and Emotional Evolution | Fall 2023 - Spring 2024
This is the repository for my research project for the Business and Economics Honors Program at NYU Shanghai during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. The project focuses on analyzing financial discourse on Weibo to understand evolving trends in topics and sentiments within the Chinese stock market context. The aim of this research is to explore how financial discussions on Weibo reflect changes in stock market trends and sentiments. The study involves: 1) identifying key topics in financial discourse using advanced topic modeling techniques like BERTopic; 2) analyzing sentiment changes using tools such as FinBERT; 3) examining the relationship between topic sentiments and stock returns. For detailed process and insights, please refer to the thesis document uploaded here: [Ruoheng Du_Thesis_NYUSH Honors 2024](./Ruoheng%20Du_Thesis_NYUSH%20Honors%202024.pdf).
